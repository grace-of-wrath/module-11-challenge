# module-11-challenge

In this challenge, I have demonstrated my ability to create Beautiful Soup objects to extract text and data from websites. In addition to scraping, I also created visualizations from the scraped data to provide key insights. 

Note: 
I referenced ChatGPT for guidance with step 3 of Part 2; specifically splitting the values in the mars_facts list, seen below:
split_mars_facts = []

for facts in mars_facts:
    split_facts = facts.split('\n')
    split_mars_facts.append(split_facts)
